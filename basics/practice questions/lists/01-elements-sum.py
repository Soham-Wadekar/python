# 1. Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a list.

lst = [23, 5, 23, 5, 3, 3, 6, 8, 867, 92, 34, 54]

list_sum = sum(lst)

print(f"The sum of the elements in the list is {list_sum}")

## ONE LINE

print(f"The sum of the elements of the list is {sum([23,5,23,5,3,3,6,8,867,92,34,54])}")
